## Overview
A perfect first challenge if you're new to HTML and CSS. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's ideal if you haven't learned about building responsive layouts yet.

## My process
I began with installing bootstrap and then realized that this project is meant for me to practice my basic HTML and CSS knowledge. I deleted everything once or twice? Coded in the simplest way I know and used CSS to style everything.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
 Simple is best!
